  Dear VGECians, Greetings from the Vishwakarma Government Engineering college - Alumni Association (VGEC-AA)!

If we walk alone, we can walk faster, If we walk together, we can walk farther.

VGEC-AA presents a platform for all our past and present students to pitch in their expertise to take forward VGEC, to its ultimate heights. Our Dear students, are the force that help this campus become so dynamic. Our young and creative minds, have made VGEC one of the foremost institutions in the state on the Innovation Quotient. Our students, spread across the globe, still come together on social media at their convenient times and once again, a virtual VGEC erupts to its full bloom! We are so ever so thankful for such a lively community, that is always present to take its Alma Mater to its full blown potential. I am sure our past and present students will nurture, cherish and enjoy this platform with their inputs. Put in all your efforts to bring every student from the past, to this one vast family of VGECians! Let's celebrate togetherness again.
</p>
